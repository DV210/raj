Lemmatization is the process that identifies the correct intended part-of-speech (POS) and
the meaning of words that are present in sentences.
In lemmatization, we remove the inflection endings and convert the word into its base form,
present in a dictionary or in the vocabulary. If we use vocabulary and morphological
analysis of all the words present in the raw text properly, then we can get high accuracy for
lemmatization.
Lemmatization transforms words present in the raw text to its lemma by using a tagged
dictionary such as WordNet.
Lemmatization uses a tagged dictionary such as WordNet. Mostly, it's a human-tagged
dictionary. So human efforts and the time it takes to make WordNet for different languages
is challenging.
